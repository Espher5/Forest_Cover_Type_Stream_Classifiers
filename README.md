# Forest_Covertype_Stream_Classifiers

This project contains an analysis of UCI's Forest Cover Type dataset and was developed for the "IoT Data Analytics" university course. 
After an initial study, both online and batch learning techniques are employed one the dataset. MOA and scikit multiflow have been used to learn on a data stream while scikit learn has been employed for traditional batch learning.
